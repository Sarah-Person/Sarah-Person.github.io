    "section": "",
    "text": "College volleyball becomes more dominant each year. Many teams and conferences have proved their worth and contend to finish on top each season. Which team is the best though?\nWhen you think of volleyball powerhouses, the Big Ten Conference may come to mind. Now while the Big Ten may have proven more dominant in recent years, when you look at history throughout the years, the Pac 12 actually holds the edge.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nrpi <- read_csv(\"rpi.csv\")\nchampions <- read_csv(\"champions.csv\")\n\nBlocksPerSet<- read_csv(\"BlocksPerSet.csv\") %>% select(-Rank)\nKillsPetSet <- read_csv(\"KillsPerSet.csv\") %>% select(-Rank)\n\nStatsLeaders <- BlocksPerSet %>% inner_join(KillsPetSet)\n\nbig <- rpi %>% \n  filter(CONFERENCE== \"Big Ten\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=rpi, aes(x=reorder(CONFERENCE,-`Average Rank`), weight=`Average Rank`,), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=big, aes(x=reorder(CONFERENCE,-`Average Rank`), weight=`Average Rank`,), fill=\"blue\") +\n  coord_flip()+\nlabs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Rank\", \n    title=\"Who is number one in the college volleyball world?\", \n    subtitle=\" According to RPI, the Pac 12 is on Top, while the Big Ten is 2nd.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Sarah Person\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=5) \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nBoth conferences are closely ranked in RPI but the Pac12 holds a slight lead. RPI isn’t the only thing that comes into account when deciding the most powerful volleyball conference.\nChampionship titles are also a big factor. Both the Big Ten and Pac 12 have won multiple titles. Each of them have won more championships than five other conferences combined.\n\n\nCode\nbig10 <- c( \"Nebraska\"=5, \"Penn State\"=7, \"Wisconsin\"=1,4)\n\npac12<- c(\"Washington\"=1,\"UCLA\"=4,\"Stanford\"=9, \"Southern California\"=3)\n\nother <- c(\"Pacific\"=2,\"Long Beach State\"=3, \"Kentucky\"=1, \"Hawaii\"=3,\"Texas\"=1, 10)\n\niron(\nwaffle(big10,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#E41C38\", \"#041E42\", \"#8C1515\", \"#FFFFFF\")) +\nlabs(\n     x=\"Big 10\",\n     title=\"Which conference is the most dominant?\",\n     subtitle=\"Each square is a title and the Pac 12 holds the edge.\") +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n   ),\n  waffle(pac12,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#4B2E83\", \"#2D68C4\", \"#8C1515\", \"#FFC72C\"),\n         ) +\nlabs(\n     x=\"Pac-12\",\n     title=\"\"),\n  waffle(other,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#E35205\", \"#FFC72A\", \"#0033A0\", \"#024731\", \"#BF5700\",\"#FFFFFF\"))+\n  labs(\n     x=\"West Coast, Big West, SEC, Mountain West, Big 12\",\n     title=\"\",\n     caption=\"Source: NCAA | Graphic by Sarah Person\"\n     )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen thinking of the best of the best, one other thing may come to mind. Who ever has the best stats is the better team right?\nWell, both the Pac 12 and the Big Ten come out on top in this category too.\n\n\nCode\nbigten<- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Penn St.\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Illinois\", \"Iowa\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan St.\", \"Indiana\", \"Ohio St.\", \"Rutgers\", \"Maryland\", \"Purdue\", \"Northwestern\", \"Minnesota\")\n\nbig<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% bigten)\n\npac12<-c (\"Oregon St.\", \"Stanford\",\"Washington St.\", \"California\", \"Oregon\", \"Washington\",\"Arizona St.\", \"Colorado\", \"Southern California\", \"Utah\", \"UCLA\",\"Arizona\")\n\npac<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% pac12) \n\ntopleaders<-c (\"Maryland\",\"Minnesota\",\"Wisconsin\",\"Nebraska\",\"Stanford\",\"Colorado\", \"Washington St.\",\"Arizona\")\n\ntopteams<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% topleaders)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=StatsLeaders, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"light grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=big, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_point(data=pac, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"orange\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data=topteams, aes(x= KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`, label=Team))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Kills Per Set \", \n    y=\"Blocks Per Set\", \n    title=\" The Big Ten and Pac 12 led the nation in stats\", \n    subtitle=\"Offensively and Defensively they both stood out among the rest.\" ,\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Sarah Person\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=5) \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten has been very dominant in the collegiate volleyball world over the past few years, but if you look at the overall success in the history of the sport, the Pac 12 actually holds the edge in rpi, championships, and stats."
