    "section": "",
    "text": "NCAA volleyball becomes more dominant each year. Many teams and conferences have proved their worth and contend to finish on top each season. Which conference is the best though? A lot of things come into play when determining this.\nWhen you think of volleyball powerhouses, the Big Ten Conference may come to mind. Everyone who follows the sport will tell you that it’s one of the toughest. The Big Ten may have proven more dominant in recent years, but when you look at overall history, the Pac 12 actually holds the edge.\nThe average person may think nothing of this, but volleyball fanatics are probably thinking that this is crazy. The Big Ten is the best right?\nNope. They are wrong.\nThe Pac 12 has been more powerful in the history of college volleyball. RPI or Rating Percentage Index is the first thing to consider when determining who is the best. It uses wins, loses, and strength of schedule to figure out the top ranked teams.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nrpi <- read_csv(\"rpi.csv\")\nchampions <- read_csv(\"champions.csv\")\n\nBlocksPerSet<- read_csv(\"BlocksPerSet.csv\") %>% select(-Rank)\nKillsPetSet <- read_csv(\"KillsPerSet.csv\") %>% select(-Rank)\n\nStatsLeaders <- BlocksPerSet %>% inner_join(KillsPetSet)\n\nbig <- rpi %>% \n  filter(CONFERENCE== \"Big Ten\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=rpi, aes(x=reorder(CONFERENCE,-`Average Rank`), weight=`Average Rank`,), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=big, aes(x=reorder(CONFERENCE,-`Average Rank`), weight=`Average Rank`,), fill=\"blue\") +\n  coord_flip()+\nlabs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Rank\", \n    title=\"Who is number one in the college volleyball world?\", \n    subtitle=\" According to RPI, the Pac 12 is on top, while the Big Ten is 2nd.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Sarah Person\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=5) \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nBoth conferences are closely ranked in RPI, but the Pac 12 holds a slight lead. RPI isn’t the only thing that comes into account when deciding the most powerful volleyball conference. Championships are also a big factor.\nBoth the Big Ten and Pac 12 have won multiple. Each of them have won more championships than five other conferences combined. Once again though, the Pac 12 comes out on top having more NCAA championship titles.\n\n\nCode\nbig10 <- c( \"Nebraska\"=5, \"Penn State\"=7, \"Wisconsin\"=1,4)\n\npac12<- c(\"Washington\"=1,\"UCLA\"=4,\"Stanford\"=9, \"Southern California\"=3)\n\nother <- c(\"Pacific\"=2,\"Long Beach State\"=3, \"Kentucky\"=1, \"Hawaii\"=3,\"Texas\"=1, 10)\n\niron(\nwaffle(big10,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#E41C38\", \"#041E42\", \"#8C1515\", \"#FFFFFF\")) +\nlabs(\n     x=\"Big 10\",\n     title=\"Which conference is the most dominant?\",\n     subtitle=\"Each square is a title and the Pac 12 holds the edge.\") +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n   ),\n  waffle(pac12,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#4B2E83\", \"#2D68C4\", \"#8C1515\", \"#FFC72C\"),\n         ) +\nlabs(\n     x=\"Pac-12\",\n     title=\"\"),\n  waffle(other,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#E35205\", \"#FFC72A\", \"#0033A0\", \"#024731\", \"#BF5700\",\"#FFFFFF\"))+\n  labs(\n     x=\"West Coast, Big West, SEC, Mountain West, Big 12\",\n     title=\"\",\n     caption=\"Source: NCAA | Graphic by Sarah Person\"\n     )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen thinking of the best of the best, one other thing may come to mind. Who ever has the best stats is the better team right? Well, both the Pac 12 and the Big Ten come out on top in this category too.\nKills and blocks are the two main statistical categories. Both conferences rank quite high in both offensive and defensive production, but the Big Ten takes the lead in these categories.\n\n\nCode\nbigten<- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Penn St.\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Illinois\", \"Iowa\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan St.\", \"Indiana\", \"Ohio St.\", \"Rutgers\", \"Maryland\", \"Purdue\", \"Northwestern\", \"Minnesota\")\n\nbig<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% bigten)\n\npac12<-c (\"Oregon St.\", \"Stanford\",\"Washington St.\", \"California\", \"Oregon\", \"Washington\",\"Arizona St.\", \"Colorado\", \"Southern California\", \"Utah\", \"UCLA\",\"Arizona\")\n\npac<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% pac12) \n\ntopleaders<-c (\"Maryland\",\"Minnesota\",\"Wisconsin\",\"Nebraska\",\"Stanford\",\"Colorado\", \"Washington St.\",\"Arizona\")\n\ntopteams<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% topleaders)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=StatsLeaders, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"light grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=big, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_point(data=pac, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"orange\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data=topteams, aes(x= KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`, label=Team))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Kills Per Set \", \n    y=\"Blocks Per Set\", \n    title=\" The Big Ten and Pac 12 lead the nation in stats\", \n    subtitle=\"Offensively and Defensively they both stood out among the rest.\" ,\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Sarah Person\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=5) \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten has been very dominant in the collegiate volleyball world over the past few years. If you look at the overall success in the history of the sport, they actually lead in offensive and defensive statistics. Leading in that alone though does not make them number one overall.\nThe Pac 12 however, does hold the edge in RPI and championship titles. Since they lead in two of the three main categories used when proving the top contender, they take the crown of being the best volleyball conference."

    "text": "The US Women’s soccer team has absolutely been tearing it up in recent years with numerous titles and awards to their name. If your a follower of international soccer chances are you have seen the team’s dominance throughout history.\nBut are they really the best? Many things come into play when determining the number one team in the world. You may take a look at the Olympics, World Cups, and even rankings.\nThe US has crushed their opponents in all three categories so are they truly the most dominant team in the world?\nThe first thing to look at when showing dominance on the international stage is Olympic Medals.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbump)\n\nolympics<-read_csv(\"olympics.csv\")\n\nwc2019 <-read_csv(\"worldcup.csv\") %>% separate(Squad, into=c(\"Abbrv\", \"Country\"), sep=\" \", extra=\"merge\") %>% mutate(Year = \"2019\", CountryYear = paste(Country, Year)) \nwc2015 <-read_csv(\"worldcup2.csv\") %>% separate(Squad, into=c(\"Abbrv\", \"Country\"), sep=\" \", extra=\"merge\") %>% mutate(Year = \"2015\", CountryYear = paste(Country, Year))\nwc2011 <-read_csv(\"worldcup3.csv\") %>% separate(Squad, into=c(\"Abbrv\", \"Country\"), sep=\" \", extra=\"merge\") %>% mutate(Year = \"2011\", CountryYear = paste(Country, Year))\n\n\nwwc <- bind_rows(wc2019, wc2015, wc2011)\n\nolympiclong<-olympics %>% pivot_longer(cols=-Year, names_to = \"Medal\", values_to = \"Country\") \n\ntotalmedals <-olympiclong %>% \n  group_by(Country, Medal) %>%\nsummarise(\n  count=n())\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(\n    data=totalmedals,\n    aes(x=Country,weight=count, fill=Medal )\n  ) +\nscale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#CD7F32\", \"gold\", \"#808080\" ))+\ncoord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Country\", \n    y=\"Total Medals\", \n    title=\"Is the US Womens Soccer Team the best in the nation?\", \n    subtitle=\" They have won more olympic medals than any other country.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sporting99 | Sarah Person\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=5) \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe US has clearly overtakes the number one when it comes to Olympic success. They have won more Gold medals than seven other countries combined and also ahve the most overall medals out of any country.\nNow Olympic medals is not the only thing to look at when proving who is the most dominant team. Another statistic to look at is World Cup titles/goals.\n\n\nCode\nUSA<-wwc %>% filter(Country==\"USA\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=wwc, aes(x=Gls, y=Year), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=USA, aes(x=Gls, y=Year), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=USA,\n    aes(x=Gls, y=Year, label=CountryYear)\n  )+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Goals\", \n    y=\"Years\", \n    title=\"Does number of world cup goals equal a deep tournament run?\", \n    subtitle=\"Each year, the US were highly ranked in goals scored and made it to the final.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FootballReference | Sarah Person\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=5) \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nDoes scoring a lot of goals in the world cup accumulate to a deep run in the tournament? In the last three world cups, the US has been either first or second in goals scored.\nThey made the championship all three times, while winning two of those. So yes, amount of goals does equal a deep run in the tournament and the US has clearly shown that.\nThere is one more thing to look at when determining the most dominant womens soccer team and that is FIFA ranking.\n\n\nCode\nFifaRankings<- read_csv(\"rankings.csv\") \n\ntop <- FifaRankings %>% filter(Date == 2023 & RK <= 10)\n\nbump <- FifaRankings %>% filter(Team %in% top$Team)\n\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bump(\n    data=bump, aes(x=Date, y=RK, color=Team) ) +\n  geom_point(data=bump, aes(x=Date, y=RK, color=Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_text(data = bump %>% filter(Date == min(Date)), aes(x = Date - .2, y=RK, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1)+\n  geom_text(data = bump %>% filter(Date == max(Date)), aes(x = Date + .2, y=RK, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0)+\n  labs(title=\"Who is the number one team in the word?\", subtitle=\"According to FIFA, the US has been constantly ranked number 1 for the last five years.\", y= \"\", x = \"\", \n  caption=\"Source: FIFA | Sarah Person\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#012169\",\"#FFDC02\", \"#e82042\",\"#FFFFFF\",\"#0050a4\",\"#000000\",\"#F36C21\",\"#8B0D11\",\"#006aa8\",\"#B31942\")) +\n    scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(2018.1,2023.9))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US has shown its dominance over the last five years as they have never lost the number one ranking. Other countries have risen and falling throughout the years, but the US has consistantly been good.\nIn conclusion, the US is the most dominant women’s soccer team in the country. They have outnumbered their opponents in multiple categories including Olympic Medals, World Cup titles/goals, and FIFA ranking."
