    "section": "",
    "text": "NCAA volleyball becomes more dominant each year. Many teams and conferences have proved their worth and contend to finish on top each season. Which conference is the best though? A lot of things come into play when determining this.\nWhen you think of volleyball powerhouses, the Big Ten Conference may come to mind. Everyone who follows the sport will tell you that it’s one of the toughest. The Big Ten may have proven more dominant in recent years, but when you look at overall history, the Pac 12 actually holds the edge.\nThe average person may think nothing of this, but volleyball fanatics are probably thinking that this is crazy. The Big Ten is the best right?\nNope. They are wrong.\nThe Pac 12 has been more powerful in the history of college volleyball. RPI or Rating Percentage Index is the first thing to consider when determining who is the best. It uses wins, loses, and strength of schedule to figure out the top ranked teams.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nrpi <- read_csv(\"rpi.csv\")\nchampions <- read_csv(\"champions.csv\")\n\nBlocksPerSet<- read_csv(\"BlocksPerSet.csv\") %>% select(-Rank)\nKillsPetSet <- read_csv(\"KillsPerSet.csv\") %>% select(-Rank)\n\nStatsLeaders <- BlocksPerSet %>% inner_join(KillsPetSet)\n\nbig <- rpi %>% \n  filter(CONFERENCE== \"Big Ten\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=rpi, aes(x=reorder(CONFERENCE,-`Average Rank`), weight=`Average Rank`,), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=big, aes(x=reorder(CONFERENCE,-`Average Rank`), weight=`Average Rank`,), fill=\"blue\") +\n  coord_flip()+\nlabs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Rank\", \n    title=\"Who is number one in the college volleyball world?\", \n    subtitle=\" According to RPI, the Pac 12 is on top, while the Big Ten is 2nd.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Sarah Person\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=5) \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nBoth conferences are closely ranked in RPI, but the Pac 12 holds a slight lead. RPI isn’t the only thing that comes into account when deciding the most powerful volleyball conference. Championships are also a big factor.\nBoth the Big Ten and Pac 12 have won multiple. Each of them have won more championships than five other conferences combined. Once again though, the Pac 12 comes out on top having more NCAA championship titles.\n\n\nCode\nbig10 <- c( \"Nebraska\"=5, \"Penn State\"=7, \"Wisconsin\"=1,4)\n\npac12<- c(\"Washington\"=1,\"UCLA\"=4,\"Stanford\"=9, \"Southern California\"=3)\n\nother <- c(\"Pacific\"=2,\"Long Beach State\"=3, \"Kentucky\"=1, \"Hawaii\"=3,\"Texas\"=1, 10)\n\niron(\nwaffle(big10,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#E41C38\", \"#041E42\", \"#8C1515\", \"#FFFFFF\")) +\nlabs(\n     x=\"Big 10\",\n     title=\"Which conference is the most dominant?\",\n     subtitle=\"Each square is a title and the Pac 12 holds the edge.\") +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n   ),\n  waffle(pac12,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#4B2E83\", \"#2D68C4\", \"#8C1515\", \"#FFC72C\"),\n         ) +\nlabs(\n     x=\"Pac-12\",\n     title=\"\"),\n  waffle(other,\n         rows=2,\n         colors=c(\"#E35205\", \"#FFC72A\", \"#0033A0\", \"#024731\", \"#BF5700\",\"#FFFFFF\"))+\n  labs(\n     x=\"West Coast, Big West, SEC, Mountain West, Big 12\",\n     title=\"\",\n     caption=\"Source: NCAA | Graphic by Sarah Person\"\n     )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen thinking of the best of the best, one other thing may come to mind. Who ever has the best stats is the better team right? Well, both the Pac 12 and the Big Ten come out on top in this category too.\nKills and blocks are the two main statistical categories. Both conferences rank quite high in both offensive and defensive production, but the Big Ten takes the lead in these categories.\n\n\nCode\nbigten<- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Penn St.\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Illinois\", \"Iowa\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan St.\", \"Indiana\", \"Ohio St.\", \"Rutgers\", \"Maryland\", \"Purdue\", \"Northwestern\", \"Minnesota\")\n\nbig<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% bigten)\n\npac12<-c (\"Oregon St.\", \"Stanford\",\"Washington St.\", \"California\", \"Oregon\", \"Washington\",\"Arizona St.\", \"Colorado\", \"Southern California\", \"Utah\", \"UCLA\",\"Arizona\")\n\npac<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% pac12) \n\ntopleaders<-c (\"Maryland\",\"Minnesota\",\"Wisconsin\",\"Nebraska\",\"Stanford\",\"Colorado\", \"Washington St.\",\"Arizona\")\n\ntopteams<-StatsLeaders %>% filter(Team %in% topleaders)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=StatsLeaders, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"light grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=big, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_point(data=pac, aes(x=KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`),color=\"orange\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data=topteams, aes(x= KillsPerSet, y=`Per Set`, label=Team))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Kills Per Set \", \n    y=\"Blocks Per Set\", \n    title=\" The Big Ten and Pac 12 lead the nation in stats\", \n    subtitle=\"Offensively and Defensively they both stood out among the rest.\" ,\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Sarah Person\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=5) \n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten has been very dominant in the collegiate volleyball world over the past few years. If you look at the overall success in the history of the sport, they actually lead in offensive and defensive statistics. Leading in that alone though does not make them number one overall.\nThe Pac 12 however, does hold the edge in RPI and championship titles. Since they lead in two of the three main categories used when proving the top contender, they take the crown of being the best volleyball conference."
